// The child_process.spawnSync(), child_process.execSync(), and child_process.execFileSync() methods are synchronous
// and WILL block the Node.js event loop, pausing execution of any additional code until the spawned process exits.
// Blocking calls like these are mostly useful for simplifying general purpose scripting tasks and for simplifying the loading/processing of application configuration at startup.
